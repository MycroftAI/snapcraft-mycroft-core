        Mycroft is a free and open-source intelligent personal assistant and knowledge
        navigator for Linux-based operating systems that uses a natural language user
        interface. It is the world's first fully open-source AI voice assistant.

        Mycroft is named after a fictional computer from 1966 science fiction novel
        "The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress".

        Installing skills by voice seems to be broken for now, but you can use
        the `mycroft.msm` command to list, install, and remove skills.
